# Project-2-closest-Pair-Point

**Closest Pair of Points in a 2D Plane**
This project computes the closest pair of points in a given 2D plane and measures the elapsed time in nanoseconds.

We implement a Divide and Conquer approach to solve the problem, achieving a time complexity of **O(n log n)**, which is significantly more efficient compared to the **O(nÂ²)** time complexity of the brute force method.
